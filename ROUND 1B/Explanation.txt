This solution is designed to analyze a diverse collection of PDFs and extract the most relevant content tailored to a specified persona and their goal. It operates fully offline and focuses on keyword-based relevance scoring to identify important sections across multiple documents.

Key Components:
Input Handling
Accepts 3 to 50 PDFs from any domain (e.g., travel, food, research). The user provides a persona and a job-to-be-done which guide the relevance scoring.

Text Extraction
Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) to extract text from each page of every PDF. This ensures granular access to document content for relevance analysis.

Relevance Scoring
Implements a simple yet effective keyword matching approach where each page is scored based on the presence of domain-relevant keywords derived from the persona’s goal.

Section Identification
The first line of each page is treated as a candidate section title, and pages with positive relevance scores are collected as important sections.

Structured Output
Produces a JSON output containing:

Metadata: persona, job description, input files, and processing timestamp

Extracted Sections: ranked by importance with document name, page number, and section title

Subsection Analysis: snippet previews from relevant pages to provide context

Benefits:
Domain Agnostic: Can process PDFs from any field due to flexible keyword input.

Scalable: Handles large collections (up to 50 PDFs) efficiently.

Offline Ready: No external API or internet access required.

Easy to Customize: Persona, job description, and keywords can be tailored to different tasks or industries.
